With On Human, we've created a customer portal that helps businesses connect with their customers in a way that is more human centric. This is a new type of space that helps business owners create a human experience for their customers that works across platforms and provides a central location to interact with their customers. These kinds of spaces have been around for a while but they were not designed with the customer in mind. They were designed to make it easy for business owners to manage their customers. We wanted to empower our users to create a space where they could give their customers the human experience they deserve. We also wanted to make it easy for them to use without having to spend months trying to figure out how it works. That's why we created the simple drag and drop builder that allows our users to quickly get up and running without having to worry about setting up integrations or CRMs or any of that stuff.

 We created a customer portal for humans. The internet is full of web tools that are great for businesses, but terrible for people. We wanted to change that.
